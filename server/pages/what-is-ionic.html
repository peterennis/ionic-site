        <h2>A worldwide developer community.</h2>
        <p>
          Ionic was founded in 2012, when using web technologies to build native
          apps was still in its infancy. When we started, we just wanted to
          create a better way for web developers to use their existing skills to
          build apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, Ionic is one of the world's most popular cross-platform mobile
          development technology stack. Ionic is backed by a <a
          href="/community">vibrant community</a> of more than 5M developers in
          over 200 countries, supporting one of the most popular open source app
          platforms in the world.

      <h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
      <h2>Why we’re betting on the web</h2>
      <p>
        The web has served developers well for the last twenty years, and we
        think that makes it a pretty great bet for the next twenty. It
        represents the most stable and time-tested universal runtime in the
        world. And today, the web is the best and only way to deliver the
        seamless experience that users have come to expect as they interact with
        apps across platforms and devices, between desktop and mobile.
