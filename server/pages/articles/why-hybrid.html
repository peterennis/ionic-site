        <li><span><strong>Cost to build and maintain:</strong> Cost is a significant concern. Can a hybrid approach help me reduce cost, without sacrificing quality?</li></span>
        <li><span><strong>Time to market:</strong> Timely development and release is critical. How will it help me to build and update apps for my target platforms?</li></span>
        <li><span><strong>Fit for development organization:</strong> I’m all for using new tools, but how do I know they’ll be a fit for my organization? Will my team be able to adopt it? What skills are required?</li></span>
