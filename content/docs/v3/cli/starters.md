## How it Works

Starters are constructed within the [Ionic Starters](https://github.com/ionic-team/starters) repository by overlaying a starter app onto a set of base files, constructing a compressed archive of the files, and uploading it around the world. The Ionic CLI then downloads and extracts the starter template archive and personalizes files for each new app.
