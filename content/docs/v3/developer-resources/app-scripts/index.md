Ionic apps utilize TypeScript and Sass code. This code needs to be converted into web browser friendly code. A build process is required to achieve this.
`@ionic/app-scripts` are a set of configurable scripts provided to make it easy to create a simple or a highly customized build process.

### How does it work?
Ionic app’s are developed typically using the `ionic serve` and `ionic cordova run` commands. Both of these commands need to compile the application’s code and combine it into one bundled file.

When `ionic serve` or `ionic cordova run` are invoked, it ultimately calls an [NPM script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts). These npm scripts call the `@ionic/app-scripts` library to execute the build process.

### Why App Scripts?
Most application’s share a similar build process. Rather than have each user create their own build process from scratch for their app, we thought that time would be better spent building out their Ionic app and leaving the details to us. This is our interpretation of what most users need from a build process.

### What About Gulp?
Historically Ionic apps have used [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as tool to facilitate the build process. Over the years, `gulp` has seen less and less development, and has started to accumulate deprecation warnings. By taking advantage of standard and dependency free NPM scripts, we are reducing dependencies and simplifying the development experience.

Note: Developers are free to still use gulp if they choose to do so. We think NPM scripts are a better approach, but there is nothing in place restricting the use of gulp if that is the preferred method.

### What Scripts are Provided?

`@ionic/app-scripts` provides the following scripts:

- [build](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/build.ts) : `build` calls a set of `@ionic/app-scripts` to compile the `TypeScript` source, compile `sass`, create a bundle `javascript` file, etc.

- [bundle](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/bundle.ts) : `bundle` uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to produce a single, high performance `javascript` file from the many smaller `javascript` files.

- [clean](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/clean.ts) : `clean` deletes any of the files generated by the `build` process. Basically, it deletes the `www` directory.

- [cleancss](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/cleancss.ts) : `cleancss` uses [CleanCSS](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css) to minify `css` to it’s smallest, fastest form.

- [closure](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/closure.ts) : `closure` uses [Google’s Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to minify `javascript` to it’s smallest, fastest form.

- [copy](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/copy.ts) : `copy` copies files where they need to go to end up in the built `www` directory.

- [lint](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/lint.ts) : `lint` runs [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) against the `TypeScript` source code. Requires a `tslint.json` file at the project root.

- [minify](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/minify.ts) : `minify` calls the minification tasks for `javascript` (uglify, or closure if available) and `css` (cleancss).

- [ngc](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/ngc.ts) : `ngc` calls the [Angular Ahead-of-time compiler](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html) to create extremely fast apps.

- [sass](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/sass.ts) : `sass` walks the application’s directory tree to find `scss` files and assemble them into one `css` file.

- [template](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/template.ts) : `template` is used to convert Angular templates into `inline-templates` for faster loading and faster applications during the development process.

- [transpile](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/transpile.ts) : `transpile` converts `TypeScript` code into `javascript` code.

- [tsc](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/tsc.ts) : `tsc` calls the `TypeScript` compiler.

- [uglifyjs](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/uglifyjs.ts) : `uglifyjs` is used to minify `javascript` to it’s smallest and fastest form.

- [watch](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/blob/master/src/watch.ts) : `watch` creates a smaller, faster `build` process to be used during application development.


### Providing Custom Build Configuration

The default configured provided by `@ionic/app-scripts` covers many of the scenarios required by developers. However, if a developer wants to customize and configure the way the build process is run, they can do so.

The easiest way to configure `@ionic/app-scripts` is to take advantage of the [config](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config#per-package-config-settings) option in the `package.json` file.


To get started, add a `config` entry to the `package.json` file. From there, developers can provide their own configuration file for things like `minification` (closure compiler, uglify2), and `bundling` (webpack).

See an example of specifying a custom configuration file below:

```json
  "config": {
    ...
    "ionic_webpack": "./config/webpack.config.js",
    "ionic_cleancss": "./config/cleancss.config.js",
    ...
  },
```

In the above example, custom configurations for `webpack` and `cleancss` are provided by a path to a config file.

The following `config` values are used to map to a task’s config file.

| Config File      | NPM Config Property |
|------------------|---------------------|
| CleanCss         | `ionic_cleancss`    |
| Closure Compiler | `ionic_closure`     |
| Copy             | `ionic_copy`        |
| NGC              | `ionic_ngc`         |
| Webpack          | `ionic_webpack`     |
| Sass             | `ionic_sass`        |
| TSLint           | `ionic_tslint`      |
| UglifyJS         | `ionic_uglifyjs`    |

The [default configurations](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts/tree/master/config) are great examples to learn about customization options.

Note: [Command line flags](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-app-scripts#command-line-flags) can also be used to provide custom configuration.

### Custom Project Structure
In most cases, the default project structure provided by Ionic works great! However, if a developer chooses to modify the structure to suit their use case, they are welcome to do so.

Using the same concepts outlined above for providing configuration using the `package.json` `config` option, developers can specify their own custom project structure.


| Config Values   | NPM Config Property | Defaults        |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| root directory  | `ionic_root_dir`    | `process.cwd()` |
| tmp directory   | `ionic_tmp_dir`     | `.tmp`          |
| src directory   | `ionic_src_dir`     | `src`           |
| www directory   | `ionic_www_dir`     | `www`           |
| build directory | `ionic_build_dir`   | `build`         |


### Ionic Environment Variable

An environment variable, `IONIC_ENV` is available in the build process to help determining whether a build is a `development` build, or a `production` build. The environment variable can be accessed like this:

```javascript
if (process.env.IONIC_ENV === 'prod') {
  console.log('we got a production buildp');
} else {
  console.log('we got a development build');
}
```

### Task Details

### Bundle

Ionic uses a tool called [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to combine multiple `javascript` files into one combined file. This process is often called bundling code for deployment.
