# Ionic CLI

The Ionic Command Line Interface (CLI) is your go-to tool for developing Ionic apps. You can follow CLI development on [Github](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli).

## Installation

Please make sure latest [Node](/docs/resources/what-is/#node) 6 LTS and [NPM](/docs/resources/what-is/#npm) 3+ are installed.

Then, install the CLI globally (you may need sudo):

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@latest
```

You can verify your installation with the `ionic --version` command.

## Getting Started

Start a new Ionic project using `ionic start`:

```bash
$ ionic start myNewProject
```

`ionic start` will prompt you to select a "starter". We recommend using the `tutorial` starter for your first app. See [Starter Templates](/docs/cli/starters.html) for a full list.

After selecting a starter, the CLI will create a new app named `myNewProject`. Once you `cd` into your project's directory, a few new commands become available to you, such as `ionic serve`:

```bash
$ cd ./myNewProject
$ ionic serve
```

While running `ionic serve`, changes you make to your app code will automatically refresh the browser. If you want to see your app on a device or emulator, you can [use Cordova](#using-cordova).

You can list available commands with the `ionic --help` command.

## Using Cordova

Integrate Ionic with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) to bring native capabilities to your app.

```bash
$ npm install -g cordova
$ ionic cordova --help
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

The `ionic cordova` commands (aside from `ionic cordova resources`) wrap the Cordova CLI. You can read about the differences in each command's `--help` page. To learn more about the commands, see the [Cordova CLI Reference](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-cli/) documentation.

* For iOS development, see the [iOS Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html).
* For Android development, see the [Android Platform Guide](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html).

## Ionic Pro

[Ionic Pro](/pro) is a powerful suite of tools and services designed for the entire app lifecycle, all in one integrated experience. Ionic Pro is fully supported in the Ionic CLI. See the [Pro Docs](/docs/pro//basics/getting-started/) to get started.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with the Ionic CLI, you can try the following:

* Make sure you're on the latest version of the CLI. Update with `npm update -g ionic`.
* Try running commands with the `--verbose` flag, which will print `DEBUG` messages.
